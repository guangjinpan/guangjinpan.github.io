Welcome to my homepage 🎉🎉. I received my B.E. degree in 2018 and my Ph.D. degree in 2024, from the School of Communication and Information Engineering, Shanghai University in China. My supervisor is Prof. Shugong Xu from GREAT Lab. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to [Prof. Shugong Xu](https://scholar.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/persons/ShugongXu) for his guidance in my research, and to Prof. Shunqing Zhang for his academic mentorship. Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at Chalmers University of Technology, working with Prof. [Henk Wymeersch](https://sites.google.com/site/hwymeers/) on AI-driven wireless localization, sensing, and communication research. I am eager to exchange ideas and collaborate with researchers in various fields such as wireless communication, positioning and sensing, and AI. 



My research interests include,
- Wireless Localization & Sensing
- Goal-oriented Communication
- Wireless AI / Large AI Model
- Wireless Media Network

🤝 Looking forward to collaboration: If you are interested in AI-driven wireless Localization/Sensing (based on foundation models, active inference, world models, AI-driven closed-loop control) but don’t yet have a concrete idea, feel free to reach out — we are very open to collaborations!



You can find my curated paper list for wireless large AI models here: [Wireless-LAM](https://github.com/guangjinpan/Wireless-Large-Model) (continuously updated).
